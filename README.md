# Moonveil: Sleep Habit App
Welcome to Moonveil! This app helps young adults build better sleep habits using simple Python code. It was created by a high school student as a learning project with GitHub Classroom.

## What Moonveil Does
- **Reminders:** Set times for notifications like "Time to wind down" or "No caffeine after 6pm."
- **Soundscapes:** Listen to relaxing background sounds to help you fall asleep.
- **App Blocking:** Limits access to distracting apps during sleep hours.
- **Home Screen:** Links to settings, user info, soundscapes, reminders, clock, and schedule.
- **User Profile:** stores users loved soundscapes, tracks users sleep, lists habits users want to start implementing

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install any dependencies (if required):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   python HomescreenUI_clean.py
   ```
