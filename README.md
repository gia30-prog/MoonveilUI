# Moonveil: Sleep Habit App
Welcome to Moonveil! This app helps young adults build better sleep habits using simple Python code. It was created by a high school student as a learning project with GitHub Classroom.

## What Moonveil Does
- **Reminders:** Set times for notifications like "Time to wind down" or "No caffeine after 6pm."
- **Soundscapes:** Listen to relaxing background sounds to help you fall asleep.
- **App Blocking:** Limits access to distracting apps during sleep hours.
- **Home Screen:** Links to settings, user info, soundscapes, reminders, clock, and schedule.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open the project in VS Code.
3. Run the Python files to explore features.
4. When prompted, use the number keys (1-7) to select options from the menu (for example, 1 for Settings, 2 for User Info, etc.).
5. Read the code comments to learn how it works.
